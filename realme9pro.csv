realme9pro,SUDHIR KUMAR  SAMAL ,5,Brilliant,Received today from Flipkart. Looking good.  Display is good in this price range. Could have been better with amoled screen. Hotstar and prime contents are really amazing to watch. Camera is also good.
realme9pro,  PROFESSOR .,4,Good choice,Very nice smartphone performance is too good camera is good in photoes and video (but video quality should be better like 4k)
realme9pro,Prabhakar Ch,3,Fair,Since I used from 1 month, mobile was hanged, I'm fully disappointed. Stucked my phone while operating mobile. But camera and good quality photos, value for money. 120hz refresh rate was smoothly handling.33w dart charging so impressive. Well Battery backup.

realme9pro,Harshith Poojary,4,Worth the money,Value for money phone. Camera details are good enough for the price but photos seems to be on bit saturated side. Performance is very good

realme9pro,YASH BHAVESHBHAI KAPADIYA,5,Great product,I am writing review after 10 days...The performance is very good as it has Snapdragon 695 5G Soc(with 5 5g bands support).The camera is also very good as it has 64 MP rear and 16 MP selfie. The battery backup is awesome, it gave around 1.5 days of battery backup, it has a massive 5000 mah battery with 33W fast charger in the box. It has a FHD+  IPS LCS display (it was good if it had Amoled) with 120Hz refresh rate.
realme9pro,Flipkart Customer,4,Wonderful,Writing after 1 week..I am very techy consumer so whosoever is reading this ,you are at right spotCamera is very good..night mode works very well sunlight photos are also good, charging at 33w is also nice 5g under 16k is a good factor but speaker is mono and not very loud decent enough, screen is very good comparable with amoled , performance is also very smooth because of ufs2.2 and 4x ram and 6gb ram which is expandable
